This is a website that allows users to play some mini games, especially when they fill bored/want to play something to chill and relax. 
It also automatically saves the user's scores to a database when their game ends, and allows them to compare their scores against the scores of other global users.
Additionally, a user can login to an account to save their username, instead of the default "Anonymous" User. (More user-specific functions such as being able to "favourite" certain games will be added in the future.) 
In the future, users will also be able to save their game progress halfway through the game, and return to the game in the next session. (only applies for certain games that are longer in nature)
